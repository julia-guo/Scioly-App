			<div class="title">What is Science Olympiad, anyway?</div><div class="stuff"><center><img src="images/sciolylogo.png" width=300px></center><br>
			In Science Olympiad, we study about a lot of different science subjects, also known as events, over the course of a few months (September-March; we do some prep in the summer before as well). Generally these are topics not typically covered in school, such as astronomy and materials science. We then show off our knowledge at test-based competitions (various college invitationals, Regionals, and States, and sometimes Nationals) and win lots of medals! Here at Montgomery, we pride ourselves as being one of the top teams in the state (#2), as well as a tight-knit family of like-minded science aficionados. Science Olympiad is really a wonderful experience, and if you're interested in joining, this site has all the resources you'll need to get started.<br><br>First, here's all of the 2017-2018 events in full:<br><div style="font-size:14px;margin-left:22px;padding-left:25px;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px;border-left:3px solid #ccc;">Anatomy & Physiology, Astronomy, Chemistry Lab, Disease Detectives, Dynamic Planet, Ecology, Experimental Design, Fermi Questions, Forensics, Game On, Helicopters, Herpetology, Hovercraft, Materials Science, Microbe Mission, Mission Possible, Mousetrap Vehicle, Optics, Remote Sensing, Rocks and Minerals, Thermodynamics, Towers, Write It Do It</div>As you can see, there's a lot of variety in what studies you can pursue! So there's definitely something for everyone, and we encourage you to find your "something." Feel free to look at these events in more detail on our event intro page.</div>
			<div class="title">How does the competition season work?</div><div class="stuff">We meet on Wednesdays and Thursdays every week. Meetings are designated as times for team members to study and practice with their teammates. After a few weeks, test-based tryouts happen. Next, competition teams are selected based off of these tryouts and evidence of commitment (i.e. going to meetings and whatnot). Competitions are day-long, and test-based as well. You may be asked to write an experimental design, take a scantron test, perform a lab, or complete a task with something you've built. A competition may be overnight on a weekend, or just a day trip on a weekday. Here's a helpful timeline of events to clarify further:<br><img src="images/sciolytimeline.png" style="max-width:100%;"></div>
